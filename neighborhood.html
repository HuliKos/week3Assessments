		<h1>My Neighborhood</h1>

		<p>
			The Addison Circle suburban retrofit is a prime example of a sustainable human-scaled urban neighborhood within a classic "edge city" setting. Unlike more typical suburban retrofits that redevelop existing developments such as malls into sustainable urban neighborhoods, Addison Circle is thought of as an edge city infill suburban retrofit. That is, the development filled vacant land within Addison rather than redeveloped existing developments. It was one of the first suburban developments of an entire downtown. It has given the community a core and a character that still charms 20 years on.
